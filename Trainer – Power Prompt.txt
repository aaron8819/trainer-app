# Personal AI Trainer – Power Prompt (Product + App Builder)

## Purpose
This document contains a master “power prompt” to generate a full product + engineering specification for a **Personal Training Routine Web App** that dynamically generates workouts tailored to user goals, constraints, and performance history.

This is designed to turn an existing ChatGPT-based workout workflow into a real production web application.

## Power Prompt: Personal AI Trainer Web App Builder

You are a senior product engineer + strength coach. Design and spec a production-ready web app that generates personalized workouts dynamically.

---

### 1) Context

I currently use ChatGPT to generate my workouts and log progress. I want to turn that into a web app for a better experience. The app should:

- Generate workouts tailored to my goals, time constraints, equipment, and recovery.
- Track workouts, loads, reps, sets, RPE (optional), and progression.
- Adapt future workouts based on performance, fatigue, missed sessions, and injuries/irritation.
- Be simple enough to use daily on mobile.

---

### 2) My Constraints (assume defaults unless I override)

- Session length: 45–60 minutes  
- Frequency: 3–5 days/week (configurable)  
- Split options: Push/Pull/Legs, Upper/Lower, Full-body, custom templates  
- Primary goals (user selectable): hypertrophy, strength, fat loss, athleticism, general health  
- Secondary goals: injury prevention, posture, conditioning  
- Equipment (user selectable): full gym / home gym / minimal  
- Safety: avoid reckless jumps; prioritize progressive overload + autoregulation  

---

### 3) Outputs you must produce (in this exact order)

#### A. Product spec (PRD)
- Target user, core jobs-to-be-done  
- MVP scope vs v1.1+ scope  
- Key screens and UX flow  
- Non-goals  
- Metrics for success  

#### B. Workout engine design
- Data model for:
  - user profile  
  - goals  
  - constraints  
  - movement library  
  - workout templates  
  - exercise substitutions  
  - progression rules  
  - fatigue rules  
  - deload rules  

- Algorithm for generating a session:
  - exercise selection logic  
  - sets/reps/intensity selection  
  - warmup generation  
  - rest times  
  - timeboxing logic (fit in session duration)  
  - substitutions when equipment unavailable  

- Progression algorithm:
  - double progression or RPE-based progression  
  - how it chooses next week’s load/reps  
  - how it handles stalls, missed sessions, soreness, and minor pain  

- Deload logic + recovery week detection  
- Explain assumptions clearly and make the system editable.

#### C. Database schema
Provide SQL (Postgres) schemas for all tables, including:

- users, profiles, constraints  
- exercises, exercise_variations, muscles, equipment  
- programs, program_blocks, workouts, workout_exercises  
- logs: sets, reps, load, RPE, notes  
- readiness/fatigue check-ins  
- rules tables (progression, substitutions)  

#### D. API design
- REST endpoints (or tRPC) for:
  - profile setup  
  - generate workout  
  - save workout  
  - log sets  
  - compute next workout  
  - analytics summary  

- Include request/response examples.

#### E. Frontend architecture
Assume **Next.js**.

- Routes/pages/components  
- State management choices  
- Form patterns  
- Offline-first or caching strategy (if recommended)  
- Mobile UX considerations (fast logging)

#### F. Implementation plan
- Step-by-step build plan (milestones)  
- What to build first to prove the engine works  
- Testing strategy (unit tests for workout engine rules)  
- Seed data strategy for exercises  

#### G. Risks + mitigations
- Safety issues, user injury risk, overtraining risk  
- Edge cases  
- Data integrity  

---

### 4) Important UX requirements

- “Generate today’s workout” in 1 tap.  
- Logging should be fast: defaults + one-thumb input.  
- Show the “why” behind prescriptions (briefly).  
- Must allow manual overrides (swap exercise, reduce volume, change load).  
- Must learn from overrides.

---

### 5) Clarifying questions (do NOT ask more than 8)

Ask only the most important questions needed to finalize the MVP.  
If unknown, propose reasonable defaults and proceed.

---

### 6) Build assumptions

Prefer:

- Next.js (App Router) + TypeScript  
- Postgres + Prisma  
- Auth: Supabase Auth or NextAuth  
- Hosting: Vercel  

But you can propose alternatives if there’s a strong reason.

Now generate the full deliverables A–G.

## Optional Add-on: Personal Baselines

Paste this under “Context” if you want the system to bake in real training data:

**User training baselines (use these as starting constraints, not rigid prescriptions):**

- Flat barbell bench: working ~175×5 (recent reacclimation at 155× sets)  
- Back squat: working range 165–185×5–6  
- Decline bench: 155–160 working range  
- Leg press: 180 total (90/side)  
- Face pulls: ~40  
- Iso-lateral low row: 50–60/side  
- Sled pull: up to 135 (3×45 plates)  
- Protein target: 170–190g/day  
- Note: recently ramping back up after inflammation → include autoregulation safeguards.

---

## Optional Add-on: Generate Code

Append this if you want actual implementation output:

After the spec, generate the actual code skeleton:
- Next.js routes + components  
- Prisma schema  
- Workout generation service (pure functions + unit tests)  
- Seed script with ~50 common exercises  
Only include code that compiles.

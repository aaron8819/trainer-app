# Audit CLI DB Validation

Use this together with `docs/09_AUDIT_PLAYBOOK.md`.
- This file is the narrow DB-backed validation runbook for the unified `npm run audit:workout` entrypoint.
- It covers environment prerequisites, preflight, and exact commands against a real database.
- The recurring operational workflow, field-reading order, red flags, and escalation rules live in `docs/09_AUDIT_PLAYBOOK.md`.

Use this when validating the audit foundation against a real database instead of mocked unit inputs.

## Prerequisites

- Set `DATABASE_URL` for the target environment.
- Prefer a disposable or read-only environment first.
- Pick a user that already has:
  - at least one saved workout week
  - at least one performed exercise with progression history
  - an active or recently completed mesocycle

## Preflight

```powershell
npm run audit:workout -- --mode historical-week --user-id <user-id> --week <week>
```

The command should print the audit preflight block and write an artifact under `artifacts/audits/`.

## Recommended Validation Runs

Historical week:

```powershell
npm run audit:workout -- --mode historical-week --user-id <user-id> --week <week> --mesocycle-id <mesocycle-id>
```

Future week:

```powershell
npm run audit:workout -- --mode future-week --user-id <user-id>
```

Mesocycle explainability preview vs seed vs reality:

```powershell
npm run audit:workout -- --env-file .env.local --mode mesocycle-explain --owner aaron8819@gmail.com
```

Read-only planner-only dry-run comparison for mesocycle explain:

```powershell
npm run audit:workout -- --env-file .env.local --mode mesocycle-explain --owner aaron8819@gmail.com --operator-debug --planner-only-dry-run --compare-repaired
```

- `--planner-only-dry-run` currently requires `--compare-repaired`.
- The artifact adds `mesocycleExplain.plannerOnlyDryRun` only for flagged runs.
- This path is diagnostic-only and must not write accepted seeds, planned workouts, receipts, replay data, or performed workouts.
- The flagged payload may include `plannerOnlyDryRun.policyOverride.status="active"` for `calves_4_4_lower_slot_allocation`. That override reruns projection for comparison only; it must not be persisted, emitted by unflagged output, written into `slotPlanSeedJson`, receipts, runtime replay, routes, UI, setup, handoff, or reseed paths.
- Read `plannerOnlyDryRun.projectionComparisons` before recommending behavior. It compares `baselineRepaired`, `plannerOnlyBase`, and `plannerOnlyWithOverride`, then reports override deltas for repair counters, suspicious/concentration/cap/duplicate rows, forbidden-primary violations, weak preselection consumption, support-floor rows, set-bump rows, and key acceptance failures.
- The flagged payload may include `plannerOnlyDryRun.calvesFourFourCandidate`, a read-only Calves 4+4 lower-slot classifier backed by that override rerun. It is evidence for future implementation planning only; worsened materiality, major, suspicious, concentration, cap, cross-week, lower_a safety, or Hamstrings-route checks must keep behavior unapproved. Read `lowerASafety`, `materialityEstimate.expected*Delta`, `materialityEstimate.evidence`, `materialityEstimate.stillUnknown`, and `policyReadiness.remainingBlockers` before treating a Week 1 shape as trial-ready.

Experimental planner-only no-repair comparison for mesocycle explain:

```powershell
npm run audit:workout -- --env-file .env.local --mode mesocycle-explain --owner aaron8819@gmail.com --operator-debug --planner-only-no-repair --compare-repaired
```

- The artifact adds `mesocycleExplain.plannerOnlyNoRepair` only for flagged runs.
- This path is read-only and disables downstream repair/shaping instead of patching planner gaps.
- The payload is compact: slot plans, missing lanes, unresolved demand, validation failures, weekly muscle totals, acceptance checks, `v2MesocyclePlan`, `v2SetDistributionIntent`, and optional comparison to the repaired projection.
- The payload includes `plannerOnlyNoRepair.acceptanceClassification`, which separates basic Week 1 no-repair shape validity from replacement readiness. Diagnostic/collateral concentration and migration scoreboards are readout unless promoted into explicit hard blockers by target, cap, forbidden-slot, set-count, or seed-replay policy.
- `plannerOnlyNoRepair.v2MesocyclePlan` summarizes the stable upper/lower 4x skeleton, Weeks 1-5 progression modifiers, deload transform intent, validation-rule statuses, and replacement-readiness blockers. It is flagged-only, read-only, and non-generative.
- `plannerOnlyNoRepair.v2SetDistributionIntent` summarizes lane-level min/preferred/max set budgets from the V2 target skeleton and weekly progression multipliers. Cap and concentration policy are validation metadata, not set-budget source truth, and the field is flagged-only, read-only, and non-generative.
- `plannerOnlyNoRepair.v2TargetVsNoRepairDiff` summarizes V2 target-skeleton alignment against the experimental no-repair output. Repaired projection is used only to mark repair-dependent lanes or legacy rescue evidence.
- It must not write accepted seeds, `slotPlanSeedJson`, receipts, planned workouts, runtime replay data, or performed workouts.

Projected current week volume:

```powershell
npm run audit:workout -- --mode projected-week-volume --user-id <user-id>
```

Current-week pre-execution guidance:

```powershell
npm run audit:workout -- --mode current-week-audit --user-id <user-id>
```

Active mesocycle dry-run slot-plan reseed audit:

```powershell
npm run audit:workout -- --mode active-mesocycle-slot-reseed --owner <owner-email>
```

Active mesocycle full slot-plan upgrade accept:

```powershell
npm run audit:workout -- --mode active-mesocycle-slot-reseed --owner <owner-email> --accept-slot-plan-upgrade
```

Legacy bounded upper-slot reseed apply:

```powershell
npm run audit:workout -- --mode active-mesocycle-slot-reseed --owner <owner-email> --apply-bounded-reseed
```

- The full accept path is server-side only and replaces only the active mesocycle's `slotPlanSeedJson`.
- The command still emits the dry-run diff artifact first, then accepts only when the live verdict is exactly `safe_to_accept_upgrade`.
- Structural guards reject candidate seeds that change slot order, omit explicit `setCount`, or reference missing exercises.
- `needs_projection_fix_first` and `not_safe_to_apply` remain hard stop verdicts.

Retrospective completed-week volume and slot review:

```powershell
npm run audit:workout -- --mode weekly-retro --user-id <user-id> --week <week> --mesocycle-id <mesocycle-id>
```

Retrospective projection-delivery drift review from a prior projected-week-volume artifact:

```powershell
npm run audit:workout -- --mode weekly-retro --user-id <user-id> --week <week> --mesocycle-id <mesocycle-id> --projection-artifact <projected-week-volume-artifact-path>
```

Future week for one explicit intent:

```powershell
npm run audit:workout -- --mode future-week --user-id <user-id> --intent pull
```

Forced deload preview:

```powershell
npm run audit:workout -- --mode deload --user-id <user-id> --intent pull
```

Progression / anchor trace:

```powershell
npm run audit:workout -- --mode progression-anchor --user-id <user-id> --exercise-id <exercise-id> --workout-id <workout-id>
```

## What To Inspect

Use this section as a quick validation smoke-check only. Full artifact interpretation order belongs in `docs/09_AUDIT_PLAYBOOK.md`.

- `historicalWeek.sessions[*].sessionSnapshot`
- `historicalWeek.sessions[*].progressionEvidence`
- `historicalWeek.sessions[*].weekClose`
- `historicalWeek.sessions[*].reconciliation`
- `sessionSnapshot.generated.traces.progression`
- `sessionSnapshot.generated.traces.deload`
- `projectedWeekVolume.projectedSessions[*].projectedContributionByMuscle`
- `projectedWeekVolume.currentWeekAudit`
- `projectedWeekVolume.interventionHints`
- `projectedWeekVolume.sessionRisks`
- `projectedWeekVolume.fullWeekByMuscle[*]`
- `weeklyRetro.projectionDeliveryDrift` when `--projection-artifact` is provided

## Expected Hardening Checks

- Deload traces include `resolvedTopSetLoad`, `resolvedSetLoads`, and `resolvedLoadSource`.
- Historical week entries expose whether a session counted toward progression history without reading code.
- Historical week entries surface linked or target-week-close state when relevant.
- Reconciliation reports generated-vs-saved drift without flattening the generated/saved layers.
- Weekly-retro exposes `planAdherence` so planned-work completion, explained runtime additions, substitutions, and unclassified drift remain separate.
- Projected-week-volume separates completed weighted volume from projected next-session, projected remaining-week, and projected full-week totals.

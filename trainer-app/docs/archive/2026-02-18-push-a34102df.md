## 🔴 CRITICAL Issues

### C1 — Triceps Hits Weekly MRV in a Single Session

- **What**: The session prescribes 18 direct triceps sets (Bench ×5 + Dip ×5 + Push-Up ×5 + Pushdown ×3). The engine's weekly MRV for triceps is 18. The entire week's ceiling is consumed in one push workout, with another push session due within the same week.
- **KB§**: "Triceps have a lower MRV (~18) because pressing compounds already stress them substantially." — *Volume Landmarks section*. Specifically, the MRV accounts for indirect stimulus from pressing — it does NOT mean you should stack 5+5+5 pressing sets as full direct triceps credits ON TOP of a pushdown.
- **Engine§**: `volume-landmarks.ts:20` — `Triceps: { mv: 4, mev: 6, mav: 12, mrv: 18 }`. The scoring/volume-tracking system counts full pressing sets as direct triceps volume, which is correct, but the optimizer allows a session to accumulate up to MRV without a per-session cap.
- **Fix**: Enforce a per-session triceps cap (~8-12 sets maximum from a single push session) before allowing additional isolation work. When 2+ compound pressing exercises are already selected, the direct triceps isolation budget should be reduced accordingly. Alternatively, weight triceps indirect volume from pressing at 0.5× rather than 1.0× when tallying against MRV.

## 🟡 WARNINGS

### W1 — Cable Triceps Pushdown Selected Over Overhead Extension

- **What**: Cable Triceps Pushdown (lengthened score 1/5) was chosen as the sole direct triceps isolation. The literature's strongest-performing triceps exercise — overhead extension — is in the filtered list as `time_budget_exceeded`, meaning it was never scored against Pushdown; it was excluded after the fact.
- **KB§**: "Overhead cable/dumbbell extensions produced ~40% more total triceps growth than pushdowns over 12 weeks (Maeo et al., 2023) — and surprisingly also grew the lateral and medial heads more, not just the long head. The long head crosses the shoulder joint and is maximally stretched in overhead position, making overhead extensions the highest-priority direct triceps exercise." — *Triceps section*
- **Engine§**: `selection-v2/scoring.ts` — Pushdown receives `sfrScore=5/5, lengthenedScore=1/5`. Overhead Extension has similar SFR but `lengthenedScore=4-5/5`. The composite score likely favors Pushdown due to SFR dominance despite the dramatically inferior stretch. The `lengthenedPosition` scoring weight may be undervalued relative to the KB evidence.
- **Fix**: For triceps specifically, boost the `lengthenedPosition` contribution in the composite score, or add a rule that prefers at least one lengthened-position triceps exercise per session (overhead extension > pushdown as default, not an alternative).

### W2 — Identical Abduction Pattern Repeated for Side Delts

- **What**: Machine Lateral Raise (4 sets) + Dumbbell Lateral Raise (4 sets) occupy two accessory slots with zero movement pattern distinction — both are unilateral/bilateral shoulder abduction in the same plane. No pattern variety is added.
- **KB§**: "Non-uniform hypertrophy is well-documented — different exercises grow different regions of the same muscle. Rotate 2-4 exercises per muscle group per mesocycle… rotating accessories for novel stimuli and joint stress management." — *Exercise selection section*
- **Engine§**: `selection-v2/optimizer.ts` — movement novelty scoring should de-duplicate same-pattern selections for the same muscle. The `movementNovelty` score for Dumbbell Lateral Raise shows 0.6 ("moderate") even though Machine Lateral Raise was already selected, suggesting the novelty score doesn't penalize identical movement patterns within the same session.
- **Fix**: After selecting an exercise targeting a muscle, penalize subsequent selections that share the same movement pattern AND target the same primary muscle — especially for isolation exercises where cross-pattern coverage is meaningful.

### W3 — Front Delt Direct Work Is Redundant

- **What**: Dumbbell Front Raise (3 direct sets) was selected despite the session already providing 4.5 indirect front delt sets from 3 pressing compounds. Total = 7.5 sets, exceeding the engine's own MAV of 7 for front delts in a single session.
- **KB§**: "Front delts often need zero direct work due to heavy indirect stimulus from all pressing movements. Most lifters need zero direct isolation." — *Shoulders section*. KB states front delt MEV=0, MAV=4-8.
- **Engine§**: `volume-landmarks.ts:13` — `Front Delts: { mv: 0, mev: 0, mav: 7 }`. The deficit-fill score for Front Raise is 0.8 ("No active volume deficits targeted") — correctly shows no deficit — yet the exercise was still selected. The optimizer should block direct front delt work when indirect volume already approaches MAV.
- **Fix**: When indirect front delt volume from the current session already exceeds `mev` (effectively always in a push session with ≥2 pressing compounds), suppress direct front delt exercises from accessory candidate pool entirely.

### W4 — Rest Period Rationale Display Is Inaccurate for All Exercise Types

- **What**: Every exercise in the session is prescribed 120 seconds rest in the explanation API, regardless of type. The engine's own `getRestSeconds` returns 180s for the main lift (bench, 6 reps, high fatigue), 90s for isolation exercises. The rationale says "2 min for isolation (local fatigue, faster recovery)" — correctly naming the intent but prescribing double the KB recommendation.
- **KB§**: "No appreciable differences when resting >90 seconds. Singer et al. (2024): resting <60 seconds may compromise hypertrophy." — *Rest periods section*. KB table: Isolation = 60-90 sec; Compound accessories = 90-120 sec; Main compounds = 2-3 min.
- **Engine§**: `prescription.ts:268-270` — `getRestSeconds()` for isolation returns `90` unconditionally. But `prescriptionRationales.rest.seconds` shows `120` for isolation. The explainability layer is not calling `getRestSeconds()` — it's using a flat 120s default regardless of exercise type, creating a mismatch between what's described and what the engine actually assigns.
- **Fix**: The prescription rationale generator should call `getRestSeconds(exercise, isMainLift, targetReps)` rather than defaulting to a flat value. Also verify that the actual `WorkoutSet.restSeconds` stored in DB matches `getRestSeconds()` output, not the rationale's 120s.

### W5 — Push-Up Ordered After Machine Lateral Raise (Isolation-Before-Compound)

- **What**: Push-Up (a compound pressing movement hitting chest/triceps/front delts) is exercise #5, after Machine Lateral Raise (#4, isolation). Compound movements generating systemic fatigue should precede isolation work.
- **KB§**: "Exercises performed first yield greater strength gains (ES = 0.32). Place priority/lagging muscles first." — *Exercise order section*.
- **Engine§**: `selection-v2/optimizer.ts` — exercise ordering within a session; compounds should sort before isolations targeting the same primary muscle.
- **Fix**: After selection, sort accessories by: isCompound first, then by primary muscle priority, then by SFR. Push-Up should slot between Dip and Cable Triceps Pushdown, not after the lateral raise.

### W6 — Triceps SRA Clock Set Too Short

- **What**: Engine `sraHours=36` for triceps. KB states triceps frequency is 2-4×/week (SRA ~48-72h). The engine allows triceps to be trained again after 36 hours when KB evidence suggests a minimum of 48 hours for adequate recovery.
- **KB§**: "Triceps: Frequency: 2-4×/week (SRA ~48-72h)." — *Triceps section*
- **Engine§**: `volume-landmarks.ts:20` — `sraHours: 36`. Should be ~48.
- **Fix**: Update triceps `sraHours` from 36 → 48.

## 🔵 INFO / Optimizations

### I1 — No Chest Fly / Lengthened-Position Chest Exercise

- **What**: All three chest exercises (Bench, Dip, Push-Up) use a pressing pattern. No fly or cable crossover targets the chest at a maximally stretched position. Dip provides 4/5 lengthened score and partially covers this, but a dedicated fly would isolate the stretch more effectively.
- **KB§**: "Dumbbell/cable flyes (isolation with superior stretch)." Wolf et al. (2023): lengthened partials trend toward superior hypertrophy (SME = -0.28). — *Chest section*
- **Engine§**: Incline Barbell Bench Press, Dumbbell Fly, Cable Fly, Low-to-High Cable Fly — all filtered for `time_budget_exceeded`. Time constraint prevented this; expected behavior given session length.
- **Fix**: Not actionable without increasing session duration. If user increases time budget, a cable fly should rank highly due to lengthened score bonus.

### I2 — Prescription Narrative Has Unit Labeling Bug

- **What**: The `overallNarrative` field displays "5×6 @ 160kg" but the load is in lbs. 160 lbs ≈ 72kg, not 160kg. The explainability layer appends "kg" to all load values regardless of user's unit preference.
- **Engine§**: `src/lib/engine/explainability/exercise-rationale.ts` — wherever `overallNarrative` is constructed, the unit suffix is hardcoded to "kg."
- **Fix**: Pass user's preferred unit (lbs/kg) into the narrative builder and format accordingly.

### I3 — `volumeStatus.muscleStatuses` Serializes as `{}` in API

- **What**: The explanation API returns `muscleStatuses: {}` despite the summary correctly stating "5 of 10 muscle groups near target volume." The per-muscle breakdown is missing from the JSON, breaking any downstream consumer of this field.
- **Engine§**: `src/app/api/workouts/[id]/explanation/route.ts:33` — `sessionContext` is passed directly to `NextResponse.json()`. If `volumeStatus.muscleStatuses` is a `Map`, it serializes to `{}`. Only `exerciseRationales` and `prescriptionRationales` are explicitly converted with `Object.fromEntries()`.
- **Fix**: Also convert `muscleStatuses` in the route: `muscleStatuses: Object.fromEntries(result.sessionContext.volumeStatus.muscleStatuses ?? [])`.

### I4 — Prescription Set Count Text Says "4-Set Protocol" But Delivers 5

- **What**: Rationale text reads "5 sets for main lift (standard 4-set protocol for main lift)" — internally inconsistent. The base is 4, modified by training age/goal to 5, but the text doesn't reflect the modifier.
- **Engine§**: Prescription rationale builder — set count reason is likely hardcoded as "standard 4-set protocol" without reflecting the actual base → modified computation.
- **Fix**: Template the rationale text to show actual base and modifier: "5 sets (base 4, ×1.25 for intermediate/hypertrophy)."

## Progressive Overload Summary

No previous push session exists. All loads are baseline/estimated. Overload tracking begins with the second push session.

---

## Recommended Actions (Priority Order)

1. **Per-session triceps cap** — `volume-landmarks.ts:20` + optimizer — When ≥2 pressing compounds are selected, reduce direct triceps isolation budget to 0-1 exercises (2-3 sets max), otherwise entire weekly MRV consumed in one session.
2. **Prioritize overhead triceps extension over pushdown** — `selection-v2/scoring.ts` — Increase `lengthenedPosition` weight in composite score OR add a muscle-specific rule defaulting to overhead extension for triceps isolation.
3. **Suppress direct front delt work when indirect volume ≥ MEV** — optimizer — Front delts reach MEV from pressing alone; block front raise from accessory pool when indirect count already exceeds 0 (MEV=0).
4. **Fix triceps sraHours: 36 → 48** — `volume-landmarks.ts:20` — Aligns with KB 48-72h recovery recommendation.
5. **Penalize same-pattern duplicate isolation selections** — `selection-v2/optimizer.ts` — After selecting Machine Lateral Raise, DB Lateral Raise should receive a significant `movementNovelty` penalty.
6. **Fix rest period rationale to use `getRestSeconds()`** — explainability prescription rationale builder — Shows 120s flat; should vary by exercise type.
7. **Fix unit label in `overallNarrative`** — explainability rationale builder — "@ 160kg" should be "@ 160 lbs."
8. **Fix `muscleStatuses` Map serialization** — `explanation/route.ts` — Convert to plain object before JSON response.
9. **Sort Push-Up before Machine Lateral Raise** — post-selection ordering — Compound before isolation.

## What's Working Well

- **Main lift prescription is correct**: 5×(6 top / 7 back-off), 160 lbs top, 141 lbs back-off (88% multiplier exact), RPE 7 for Week 1 accumulation. Load and rep math is right.
- **Split assignment is correct**: Chest, Triceps, Front/Side Delts all correctly routed to push day.
- **SRA compliance**: 41.8 hours between pull and push, zero overlapping primary muscles — clean separation.
- **Dip selection**: High lengthened score (4/5) for chest correctly cited by both KB and rationale. Good pick.
- **Block phase framing**: Accumulation Week 1, volume-building, RPE conservative (RIR 2.5-3) — appropriate early-mesocycle calibration.
- **FilteredExercises card**: Correctly shows `time_budget_exceeded` for all excluded exercises — fix from previous manual test is working.
- **Pull workout (f58334e2)**: Excellent exercise selection — T-Bar Row + Cable Pullover + Chest-Supported Row covers horizontal thickness, lat isolation with stretch, and face pull covers rear delts. Zero movement redundancy.

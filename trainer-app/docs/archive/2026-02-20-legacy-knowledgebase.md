# DEPRECATED: Legacy Knowledgebase Docs

Owner: Aaron  
Last reviewed: 2026-02-20  
Purpose: Tombstone for removed research narrative docs that were not authoritative runtime contracts.

This doc covers:
- Why knowledgebase docs were removed from canonical docs
- Where to find current runtime behavior documentation

Invariants:
- Canonical docs describe implementation behavior from code, not speculative research extrapolation.

Sources of truth:
- `trainer-app/docs/02_DOMAIN_ENGINE.md`
- `trainer-app/src/lib/engine`
- `trainer-app/src/lib/api`

Date archived: 2026-02-20  
Why deprecated: Research-heavy narrative docs were not a reliable runtime contract and were not required for operating or extending the current implementation.

What replaced it:
- Runtime-first references in `docs/02_DOMAIN_ENGINE.md` with direct code paths

Salvaged sections:
- None copied verbatim; only behavior that is present in engine code was retained

# 20 Evidence-Based Workouts (≤60 Minutes Each)

**Conventions:** All sets are working sets (excludes warm-up). Rest periods: 2–3 min for compounds, 60–90 sec for isolations, 60–90 sec between superset pairs. Target RIR: 1–3 (intermediate). "SS" = superset. Time estimates assume ~2.5 min/set for compounds (including rest) and ~1.5 min/set for isolations.

## Workout 1 — Push A: Chest Emphasis

| # | Exercise | Sets × Reps | Rest |
|---|----------|-------------|------|
| 1 | Barbell Bench Press | 4 × 6–8 | 3 min |
| 2 | Incline Dumbbell Bench Press | 3 × 8–10 | 2 min |
| 3 | Cable Fly | 3 × 10–15 | 90 sec |
| 4 | Overhead Cable Triceps Extension | 3 × 10–15 | 90 sec |
| 5 | Cable Lateral Raise | 3 × 12–20 | 60 sec |

**Total:** 16 sets · ~50 min

**Why it works:** Flat bench provides maximal mechanical tension on the sternal pec with heavy loads. Incline DB press at ~30° targets the clavicular head with a deeper ROM than barbell. Cable flyes load the chest at peak stretch (lengthened-position score: 5), the most actionable recent finding for hypertrophy. Overhead triceps extension is the single highest-priority direct triceps exercise per Maeo et al. (2023): +40% more growth than pushdowns. Lateral raises tacked on at the end exploit side delts' fast recovery (SRA 24–48h) without meaningful fatigue cost.

---

## Workout 2 — Push B: Shoulder Emphasis

| # | Exercise | Sets × Reps | Rest |
|---|----------|-------------|------|
| 1 | Barbell Overhead Press | 4 × 5–8 | 3 min |
| 2 | Machine Chest Press | 3 × 8–12 | 2 min |
| 3 | Dumbbell Lateral Raise | 4 × 12–20 | 60 sec |
| 4 | Incline Dumbbell Fly | 3 × 10–15 | 90 sec |
| 5 | Rope Triceps Pushdown | 3 × 10–15 | 60 sec |

**Total:** 17 sets · ~52 min

**Why it works:** OHP as the lead lift prioritizes front/side delt strength and recruits triceps and upper back as stabilizers. Machine chest press (SFR: 5) delivers chest stimulus with minimal systemic fatigue after a fatiguing standing press. Four sets of lateral raises at high reps exploit the side delts' tolerance for extreme volume (MRV ~26 sets/week). Incline flyes provide upper chest stretch. The pushdown variation at the end avoids overlapping with the overhead position already hit by OHP.

---

## Workout 3 — Pull A: Back Width (Vertical Focus)

| # | Exercise | Sets × Reps | Rest |
|---|----------|-------------|------|
| 1 | Weighted Pull-Up | 4 × 4–8 | 3 min |
| 2 | Lat Pulldown | 3 × 8–12 | 2 min |
| 3 | Cable Pullover | 3 × 10–15 | 90 sec |
| 4 | Incline Dumbbell Curl | 3 × 8–12 | 90 sec |
| 5 | Face Pull | 3 × 12–15 | 60 sec |

**Total:** 16 sets · ~50 min

**Why it works:** Weighted pull-ups are the highest-tension vertical pull in the database, driving lat width through heavy mechanical loading. Lat pulldown adds moderate-rep volume with lower fatigue (SFR: 5). Cable pullover is the best lengthened-position back exercise (score: 5)—it isolates lats at extreme stretch, aligning with the lengthened-bias evidence. Incline DB curls (lengthened score: 5) stretch the long head of the biceps with the shoulder extended behind the body, confirmed by Pedrosa (2023). Face pulls address rear delts and external rotators for shoulder health.

---

## Workout 4 — Pull B: Back Thickness (Horizontal Focus)

| # | Exercise | Sets × Reps | Rest |
|---|----------|-------------|------|
| 1 | Barbell Row | 4 × 5–8 | 3 min |
| 2 | Chest-Supported Dumbbell Row | 3 × 8–12 | 2 min |
| 3 | Seated Cable Row | 3 × 10–12 | 2 min |
| 4 | Bayesian Curl | 3 × 10–15 | 90 sec |
| 5 | Reverse Pec Deck | 3 × 10–15 | 60 sec |

**Total:** 16 sets · ~52 min

**Why it works:** Barbell rows provide heavy mechanical tension across lats, upper back, and lower back. Chest-supported DB rows (SFR: 5) remove spinal loading entirely, allowing more upper back volume without additional axial fatigue. Seated cable row delivers constant tension through full ROM. Bayesian curls (SFR: 5, lengthened: 5) are the highest-rated biceps exercise in the database for stretch-under-load. Reverse pec deck hits rear delts with zero setup cost.

---

## Workout 5 — Legs A: Quad Dominant

| # | Exercise | Sets × Reps | Rest |
|---|----------|-------------|------|
| 1 | Barbell Back Squat | 4 × 5–8 | 3 min |
| 2 | Hack Squat | 3 × 8–12 | 2.5 min |
| 3 | Leg Extension | 3 × 12–20 | 90 sec |
| 4 | Seated Leg Curl | 3 × 12–20 | 90 sec |
| 5 | Standing Calf Raise | 4 × 12–20 | 60 sec |

**Total:** 17 sets · ~55 min

**Why it works:** Deep back squats produce superior quad hypertrophy vs. shallow squats (Bloomquist, 2013) and also meaningfully grow glutes equal to hip thrusts (Plotkin, 2023). Hack squat adds quad volume with less spinal stress. Leg extensions uniquely target rectus femoris, which crosses the hip and is underloaded by squats (Burke, 2024). Seated leg curls > lying/prone for hamstrings because the hip-flexed position stretches the muscle at longer lengths (Maeo, 2021; lengthened score: 5). Standing calf raises target gastrocnemius in knee-extension—superior to seated for the visible calf muscle (Kinoshita/Maeo, 2023).

---

## Workout 6 — Legs B: Posterior Chain Dominant

| # | Exercise | Sets × Reps | Rest |
|---|----------|-------------|------|
| 1 | Romanian Deadlift | 4 × 6–10 | 3 min |
| 2 | Bulgarian Split Squat | 3 × 8–12/leg | 2 min |
| 3 | Seated Leg Curl | 3 × 12–20 | 90 sec |
| 4 | Barbell Hip Thrust | 3 × 8–12 | 2 min |
| 5 | Seated Calf Raise | 3 × 12–20 | 60 sec |

**Total:** 16 sets · ~55 min

**Why it works:** RDLs (lengthened score: 5) deliver massive hamstring and glute stretch under heavy load—the ideal hip hinge for hypertrophy. Bulgarian split squats (lengthened score: 5) hit glutes and quads unilaterally through a deep range, addressing imbalances. Seated leg curls cover knee flexion (short head of biceps femoris only crosses the knee—hip hinges alone are insufficient). Hip thrusts produce the highest glute EMG and provide a shortened-bias stimulus that complements the stretch-bias RDLs. Seated calf raises target the soleus specifically, which is underloaded by standing variations.

---

## Workout 7 — Upper Body A: Horizontal Push/Pull

| # | Exercise | Sets × Reps | Rest |
|---|----------|-------------|------|
| 1A | Dumbbell Bench Press | 4 × 6–10 | SS |
| 1B | Chest-Supported T-Bar Row | 4 × 6–10 | 90 sec |
| 2A | Cable Fly | 3 × 10–15 | SS |
| 2B | Cable Rear Delt Fly | 3 × 10–15 | 60 sec |
| 3A | Overhead Cable Triceps Extension | 3 × 10–15 | SS |
| 3B | Incline Dumbbell Curl | 3 × 10–15 | 60 sec |

**Total:** 20 sets · ~48 min (supersets cut time ~40%)

**Why it works:** Agonist-antagonist supersets save ~50% time with comparable hypertrophy (Zhang et al., 2025). DB bench provides deeper chest stretch than barbell. Chest-supported T-bar row (SFR: 5) delivers heavy back thickness with zero spinal fatigue. Cable fly + rear delt fly superset targets lengthened chest and rear delts. The arm superset pairs the two highest-rated lengthened exercises for biceps and triceps in the database.

---

## Workout 8 — Upper Body B: Vertical Push/Pull

| # | Exercise | Sets × Reps | Rest |
|---|----------|-------------|------|
| 1A | Chin-Up | 4 × 5–10 | SS |
| 1B | Dumbbell Overhead Press | 4 × 6–10 | 90 sec |
| 2A | Straight-Arm Pulldown | 3 × 10–15 | SS |
| 2B | Dumbbell Lateral Raise | 3 × 12–20 | 60 sec |
| 3 | Lying Triceps Extension (Skull Crusher) | 3 × 8–12 | 90 sec |
| 4 | Cable Curl | 3 × 10–15 | 60 sec |

**Total:** 20 sets · ~50 min

**Why it works:** Chin-ups hit lats and biceps in a lengthened position (score: 4) while DB OHP addresses front delts, side delts, and triceps—a clean vertical antagonist pair. Straight-arm pulldowns (SFR: 5, lengthened: 5) isolate lats at peak stretch. Lateral raises exploit the side delts' extreme volume tolerance. Skull crushers load the long head of triceps in a semi-lengthened position. Cable curls provide constant-tension biceps work.

---

## Workout 9 — Full Body A

| # | Exercise | Sets × Reps | Rest |
|---|----------|-------------|------|
| 1 | Barbell Back Squat | 3 × 5–8 | 3 min |
| 2 | Incline Dumbbell Bench Press | 3 × 8–10 | 2 min |
| 3 | Seated Cable Row | 3 × 8–12 | 2 min |
| 4 | Seated Leg Curl | 3 × 12–20 | 90 sec |
| 5 | Cable Lateral Raise | 3 × 12–20 | 60 sec |
| 6 | Standing Calf Raise | 3 × 12–20 | 60 sec |

**Total:** 18 sets · ~55 min

**Why it works:** Full-body sessions allow each muscle group to be trained 2–3×/week, which meta-analyses show is significantly better than 1×/week for hypertrophy (Schoenfeld, 2016). This session covers all major patterns—squat, horizontal push, horizontal pull—with accessory work for hamstrings, side delts, and calves. Per-session volume per muscle stays well under 10 sets, avoiding diminishing returns within a session. Efficient for distributing weekly volume across multiple days.

---

## Workout 10 — Full Body B

| # | Exercise | Sets × Reps | Rest |
|---|----------|-------------|------|
| 1 | Trap Bar Deadlift | 3 × 3–6 | 3 min |
| 2 | Dumbbell Bench Press | 3 × 8–10 | 2 min |
| 3 | Lat Pulldown | 3 × 8–12 | 2 min |
| 4 | Leg Extension | 3 × 12–20 | 90 sec |
| 5 | Overhead Dumbbell Extension | 3 × 10–15 | 90 sec |
| 6 | Dumbbell Curl | 3 × 8–15 | 60 sec |

**Total:** 18 sets · ~55 min

**Why it works:** Trap bar deadlift (SFR: 3) provides heavy posterior chain and quad loading with a more joint-friendly position than conventional pulls. DB bench adds chest + front delt + tricep volume. Lat pulldown delivers back width. Leg extensions isolate the rectus femoris uniquely. Overhead DB extension targets all three tricep heads (Maeo, 2023). Direct arm work finishes the session when fatigue is highest—ideal for isolations where form breakdown is less risky.

---

## Workout 11 — Full Body C

| # | Exercise | Sets × Reps | Rest |
|---|----------|-------------|------|
| 1 | Romanian Deadlift | 3 × 6–10 | 3 min |
| 2 | Machine Chest Press | 3 × 8–12 | 2 min |
| 3 | Pull-Up | 3 × 5–10 | 2 min |
| 4 | Bulgarian Split Squat | 3 × 8–12/leg | 2 min |
| 5 | Face Pull | 3 × 12–15 | 60 sec |
| 6 | Seated Calf Raise | 3 × 12–20 | 60 sec |

**Total:** 18 sets · ~55 min

**Why it works:** RDL anchors the session with hamstring/glute stretch-under-load. Machine chest press (SFR: 5) maintains push volume with virtually no systemic fatigue. Pull-ups add vertical pull volume for lat width. Bulgarians unilaterally address quads, glutes, and adductors through a deep stretch. Face pulls maintain rear delt and rotator cuff health. Seated calf raises target soleus, complementing standing variations in other sessions.

---

## Workout 12 — Chest + Back (Antagonist Supersets)

| # | Exercise | Sets × Reps | Rest |
|---|----------|-------------|------|
| 1A | Barbell Bench Press | 4 × 5–8 | SS |
| 1B | Barbell Row | 4 × 5–8 | 2 min |
| 2A | Incline Dumbbell Bench Press | 3 × 8–10 | SS |
| 2B | One-Arm Dumbbell Row | 3 × 8–12 | 90 sec |
| 3A | Cable Fly | 3 × 10–15 | SS |
| 3B | Straight-Arm Pulldown | 3 × 10–15 | 60 sec |

**Total:** 20 sets · ~45 min

**Why it works:** Pure push/pull antagonist superset session. Zhang et al. (2025) meta-analysis: comparable hypertrophy in ~50% of the time. The agonist recovers while the antagonist works. Exercise selection progresses from heavy compounds (bench/row) to moderate compounds (incline DB/1-arm row) to high-SFR isolations (cable fly/straight-arm pulldown). Both the fly and pulldown score 5 for lengthened position—maximal stretch under load for both chest and lats. 1:1 push-pull ratio maintains structural balance.

---

## Workout 13 — Arms: Biceps + Triceps

| # | Exercise | Sets × Reps | Rest |
|---|----------|-------------|------|
| 1A | Close-Grip Bench Press | 3 × 6–10 | SS |
| 1B | EZ-Bar Curl | 3 × 8–12 | 90 sec |
| 2A | Overhead Cable Triceps Extension | 3 × 10–15 | SS |
| 2B | Incline Dumbbell Curl | 3 × 10–12 | 60 sec |
| 3A | Rope Triceps Pushdown | 3 × 12–15 | SS |
| 3B | Hammer Curl | 3 × 10–15 | 60 sec |
| 4 | Cable Curl | 2 × 12–15 | 60 sec |

**Total:** 20 sets · ~42 min

**Why it works:** Supersetted arm day is extremely time-efficient due to the antagonist pairing and small-muscle recovery (SRA: 24–48h for biceps and triceps). Close-grip bench provides heavy overload on triceps in a compound pattern. Overhead extension targets the long head at full stretch—the highest-priority triceps exercise. Incline curls (lengthened: 5) stretch the biceps long head. Hammer curls add brachialis and brachioradialis development. Every major head of both muscle groups is addressed: long + lateral + medial triceps; long + short head biceps; brachialis.

---

## Workout 14 — Shoulders + Arms

| # | Exercise | Sets × Reps | Rest |
|---|----------|-------------|------|
| 1 | Seated Barbell Overhead Press | 4 × 5–8 | 3 min |
| 2 | Machine Lateral Raise | 4 × 12–20 | 60 sec |
| 3A | Overhead Dumbbell Extension | 3 × 10–15 | SS |
| 3B | Bayesian Curl | 3 × 10–15 | 60 sec |
| 4A | Cable Triceps Pushdown | 3 × 10–15 | SS |
| 4B | Preacher Curl | 3 × 8–12 | 60 sec |
| 5 | Reverse Pec Deck | 2 × 12–15 | 60 sec |

**Total:** 22 sets · ~52 min

**Why it works:** Seated OHP builds pressing strength with heavy loads and reduced stabilization demand vs. standing. Machine lateral raises (SFR: 5, fatigue: 1) provide maximum side delt stimulus per unit of fatigue—the most efficient exercise in the database for shoulder width. Overhead DB extension and Bayesian curl form the ideal stretch-maximizing arm superset. Pushdowns target medial/lateral heads; preacher curls isolate the short head. Reverse pec deck closes out rear delts. All three delt heads are hit without needing direct front delt isolation (front delts MEV: 0 due to pressing volume).

---

## Workout 15 — Posterior Chain (Hamstrings + Glutes + Back)

| # | Exercise | Sets × Reps | Rest |
|---|----------|-------------|------|
| 1 | Conventional Deadlift | 4 × 3–5 | 3–4 min |
| 2 | Good Morning | 3 × 8–12 | 2 min |
| 3 | Seated Leg Curl | 3 × 12–20 | 90 sec |
| 4 | Back Extension (45 Degree) | 3 × 10–15 | 90 sec |
| 5 | Reverse Hyperextension | 3 × 10–15 | 90 sec |

**Total:** 16 sets · ~55 min

**Why it works:** The conventional deadlift is the heaviest compound in the database (fatigue: 5) but also the greatest total-body tension generator—justifying the high fatigue cost for a dedicated posterior chain day. Good mornings load hamstrings and glutes at long muscle lengths (lengthened: 5). Seated leg curls address the knee-flexion gap that hip hinges miss (the short head of the biceps femoris only crosses the knee). Back extensions and reverse hyperextensions (SFR: 4 each) are high-efficiency glute/hamstring/erector movements with very low systemic fatigue, allowing additional volume without overreaching.

## Workout 16 — Quads + Calves

| # | Exercise | Sets × Reps | Rest |
|---|----------|-------------|------|
| 1 | Front Squat | 4 × 5–8 | 3 min |
| 2 | Leg Press | 3 × 8–12 | 2.5 min |
| 3 | Leg Extension | 3 × 12–20 | 90 sec |
| 4 | Sissy Squat | 2 × 8–15 | 90 sec |
| 5 | Standing Calf Raise | 4 × 12–20 | 60 sec |
| 6 | Seated Calf Raise | 3 × 12–20 | 60 sec |

**Total:** 19 sets · ~57 min

**Why it works:** Front squats force an upright torso, making this the most quad-dominant barbell squat variation with meaningful core/upper back recruitment. Leg press adds heavy quad volume without spinal loading. Leg extensions uniquely target rectus femoris. Sissy squats (lengthened: 5) provide extreme knee-flexion stretch on the quads—among the highest lengthened-position exercises for this muscle. Both standing and seated calf raises are included: standing for gastrocnemius (Kinoshita/Maeo, 2023), seated for soleus—both are necessary for complete calf development. Deep dorsiflexion stretch at the bottom of each rep is critical (Kassiano, 2023: 15.2% vs 3.4% growth).

---

## Workout 17 — Push + Pull Supersets (Time-Efficient Upper)

| # | Exercise | Sets × Reps | Rest |
|---|----------|-------------|------|
| 1A | Machine Chest Press | 3 × 8–12 | SS |
| 1B | Chest-Supported Dumbbell Row | 3 × 8–12 | 90 sec |
| 2A | Machine Shoulder Press | 3 × 8–12 | SS |
| 2B | Close-Grip Lat Pulldown | 3 × 8–12 | 90 sec |
| 3A | Pec Deck Machine | 3 × 10–15 | SS |
| 3B | Reverse Pec Deck | 3 × 10–15 | 60 sec |
| 4A | Cable Triceps Pushdown | 3 × 10–15 | SS |
| 4B | Cable Curl | 3 × 10–15 | 60 sec |

**Total:** 24 sets · ~48 min

**Why it works:** Pure machine/cable-based superset session designed for maximum volume in minimum time. Every exercise is SFR 5—the highest stimulus-to-fatigue ratio available. This allows 24 working sets in under 50 minutes. Machines eliminate stabilization bottlenecks, allowing true failure training where it matters. Pec deck + reverse pec deck is the ideal superset: same machine, opposite motion. This session is excellent during an accumulation block where volume is the primary driver and systemic fatigue must be managed.

## Workout 18 — Glute Specialization

| # | Exercise | Sets × Reps | Rest |
|---|----------|-------------|------|
| 1 | Barbell Hip Thrust | 4 × 8–12 | 2 min |
| 2 | Bulgarian Split Squat | 3 × 8–12/leg | 2 min |
| 3 | Romanian Deadlift | 3 × 8–10 | 2.5 min |
| 4 | Cable Pull-Through | 3 × 10–15 | 90 sec |
| 5 | Hip Abduction Machine | 3 × 10–15 | 60 sec |
| 6 | Walking Lunge | 2 × 10–12/leg | 90 sec |

**Total:** 18 sets · ~58 min

**Why it works:** Hip thrusts lead with the highest glute EMG movement (Contreras, 2015: 69.5% upper glute activation). Bulgarians provide deep unilateral stretch on the glutes (lengthened: 5) while also hitting quads and adductors. RDLs cover hip extension through a long-muscle-length range. Cable pull-throughs (SFR: 4) are a lower-fatigue hip hinge that maintains constant tension. Hip abductions directly target the gluteus medius—often neglected. Walking lunges at the end exploit accumulated fatigue for metabolic stress as a secondary driver.

---

## Workout 19 — Back + Biceps

| # | Exercise | Sets × Reps | Rest |
|---|----------|-------------|------|
| 1 | T-Bar Row | 4 × 6–10 | 2.5 min |
| 2 | Lat Pulldown | 3 × 8–12 | 2 min |
| 3 | Meadows Row | 3 × 8–12 | 90 sec |
| 4 | Dumbbell Pullover | 3 × 10–15 | 90 sec |
| 5 | Incline Dumbbell Curl | 3 × 8–12 | 90 sec |
| 6 | Hammer Curl | 3 × 10–15 | 60 sec |

**Total:** 19 sets · ~55 min

**Why it works:** T-bar row provides heavy mid-back thickness with better SFR (4) than barbell rows (3). Lat pulldown covers vertical pull for width. Meadows row is a unilateral lat/upper back exercise addressing side-to-side imbalances. Dumbbell pullover (lengthened: 5) is the ultimate lat isolation at extreme stretch. Incline DB curls stretch the biceps long head with shoulder extended behind the body—confirmed superior by Pedrosa (2023). Hammer curls develop the brachialis, which adds arm thickness visible from the front. Both horizontal and vertical pulling are covered, and the pulling movements pre-fatigue biceps, reducing the direct sets needed.

## Workout 20 — Chest + Shoulders + Triceps (Push Volume Day)

| # | Exercise | Sets × Reps | Rest |
|---|----------|-------------|------|
| 1 | Incline Barbell Bench Press | 4 × 6–8 | 3 min |
| 2 | Dip (Chest Emphasis) | 3 × 8–12 | 2 min |
| 3 | Low-to-High Cable Fly | 3 × 10–15 | 90 sec |
| 4 | Arnold Press | 3 × 8–12 | 2 min |
| 5 | Machine Lateral Raise | 3 × 12–20 | 60 sec |
| 6 | Overhead Cable Triceps Extension | 3 × 10–15 | 90 sec |

**Total:** 19 sets · ~55 min

**Why it works:** Incline barbell bench hits upper chest + front delts + triceps as the primary compound. Chest dips provide stretch at the bottom (lengthened: 4) and emphasize the sternal pec from a different angle than pressing. Low-to-high cable flyes (SFR: 5, lengthened: 5) target upper chest fibers through a full stretch with constant tension. Arnold presses rotate through the full delt range, uniquely hitting side delts through the press pattern (lengthened: 4). Machine lateral raises add the highest-efficiency side delt volume possible (fatigue: 1). Overhead cable extension caps off with the single most important direct triceps exercise. Every push muscle is addressed with intentional exercise variety to promote non-uniform regional hypertrophy.

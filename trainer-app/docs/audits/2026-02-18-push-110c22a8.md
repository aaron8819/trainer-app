## 🟡 WARNINGS

### W1 — Per-session chest volume (15 sets) exceeds KB per-session guideline

- **What**: Three consecutive chest-primary exercises accumulate 15 direct sets: Incline DB Bench (5) + Dip (5) + Deficit Push-Up (5). The KB explicitly caps per-session productive volume at 10–12 hard sets for a single muscle group before diminishing returns dominate. Sets 11–15 are likely junk volume — generating fatigue and recovery debt with negligible incremental stimulus.
- **KB§**: *"RP emphasizes that per-session volume should not exceed ~10-12 hard sets for a single muscle group due to diminishing returns."* — §2 Frequency
- **Engine§**: `src/lib/engine/selection-v2/optimizer.ts` — No per-session muscle-cap exists. The optimizer enforces a time budget but not a per-muscle session ceiling. Any push session can accumulate unlimited chest sets as long as time remains.
- **Fix**: Add a `maxSetsPerMusclePerSession` constraint (e.g., 10–12) to the optimizer. When a muscle group has already accumulated ≥10 direct sets this session, treat further exercises whose primary target is that muscle as ineligible or penalized.

### W2 — Skull Crusher chosen instead of overhead triceps extension; long head undertrained

- **What**: The session's only dedicated triceps isolation is a Skull Crusher (arms horizontal, ~90° shoulder flexion). The long head of the triceps crosses the shoulder joint and reaches maximum stretch only when the arm is fully overhead. The KB cites a landmark 12-week RCT showing overhead extensions produced ~40% more total triceps growth than pushdowns — and the overhead group grew the lateral and medial heads *more* too, not just the long head. Skull crushers are intermediate (better than pushdowns, worse than overhead), and the engine scores them 4/5 for lengthened position, which appears slightly generous relative to the KB hierarchy.
- **KB§**: *"Overhead cable/dumbbell extensions (Maeo et al., 2023: produced ~40% more total triceps growth than pushdowns over 12 weeks). The long head crosses the shoulder joint and is maximally stretched in overhead position, making overhead extensions the highest-priority direct triceps exercise."* — §4 Triceps
- **Engine§**: `src/lib/engine/selection-v2/scoring.ts` — The lengthened-position score for Skull Crusher appears to be 4/5 in exercise data. Overhead Dumbbell Extension scored similarity 0.725 (listed as an alternative) but was excluded by time budget. The issue is that skull crusher and overhead extension likely share a similar `lengthenedPositionScore` in the engine, not reflecting the Maeo 2023 hierarchy.
- **Fix**: In exercise seed data, give overhead extensions a higher `lengthenedPositionScore` (5/5) and skull crushers a lower one (3/5 or 3.5/5) to reflect that skull crushers do not achieve true long-head stretch. This would make overhead extensions win the triceps isolation slot more reliably when time permits.

### W3 — Front delt direct volume (8 sets) exceeds weekly MAV (7) within a single session

- **What**: Incline DB Bench credits 5 direct front delt sets + DB Overhead Press credits 3 direct front delt sets = **8 direct front delt sets this session** before the week has even started. Engine MAV for front delts is 7 sets/week. In a standard PPL run with 2 push sessions/week, front delts would accumulate ~16 sets/week vs MRV of 12 — a **MRV violation every single week**. Even with 1 push session/week, one session already pushes past MAV.
- **KB§**: *"Front delts: MEV 0, MAV 4-8, MRV ~12. Get massive indirect volume from all pressing. Most lifters need zero direct isolation."* — §4 Shoulders; also §2 Volume Landmarks table: Front Delts MAV 6–8, MRV ~12.
- **Engine§**: `src/lib/engine/volume-landmarks.ts:13` — `"Front Delts": { mv: 0, mev: 0, mav: 7, mrv: 12 }`. The engine correctly defines the MAV at 7 but has no mechanism to check per-session accumulation against weekly MAV. Additionally, exercise seed data for Incline DB Bench appears to list Front Delts as a **primary** muscle (receiving full 5-set credit), equal to Chest. At a 30° incline, front delts are involved but are secondary to chest; giving them equal full-credit likely inflates front delt volume significantly.
- **Fix**: (1) Re-evaluate whether Front Delts should be a secondary (partial credit) vs primary muscle on incline pressing variations in seed data. (2) The per-session cap fix from W1 would also protect front delts from this pattern.

### W4 — Triceps per-session volume (11 direct sets) at upper productive limit; MRV risk in 2×/week push

- **What**: OHP (3 sets) + Dip (5 sets) + Skull Crusher (3 sets) = 11 direct triceps sets in one session — right at the KB's 10–12 per-session ceiling. More critically, if push is trained 2×/week (standard PPL), weekly triceps volume reaches ~22 sets vs engine MRV of 18 and KB MRV of ~18. That's a **weekly MRV violation by ~4 sets**.
- **KB§**: *"Triceps: MEV 4-6, MAV 10-14, MRV ~18 sets/week (lower than biceps due to heavy indirect stimulus from pressing)."* — §2 Volume Landmarks; and *"per-session volume should not exceed ~10-12 hard sets"* — §2 Frequency.
- **Engine§**: `src/lib/engine/volume-landmarks.ts:20` — `"Triceps": { mv: 4, mev: 6, mav: 12, mrv: 18 }`. The engine's weekly tracking will catch this over time, but no single-session triceps cap prevents accumulation within a session.
- **Fix**: Same per-session muscle cap fix as W1 applies here. The compound-heavy structure of push days (OHP + Dips both generating large triceps volume) makes triceps particularly susceptible to within-session over-accumulation.

---

### W5 — Dip rest period (120s) is at the floor for a high-effort compound

- **What**: Dips are prescribed 5 sets × 10 reps with 120s rest. The exercise is a multi-joint compound loading chest and triceps heavily. KB guidance for compound accessories at 6–12 reps is 2–3 minutes. 120s (2 min) is the absolute minimum of the KB range and likely insufficient between later sets when accumulated fatigue is significant, degrading set quality and effective stimulus.
- **KB§**: *"Compound accessories (6-12 reps): 2–3 min. Never sacrifice set quality for shorter rest. Longer rest → better recovery → more weight/reps → more total volume → more growth."* — §2 Exercise Order and Rest Periods
- **Engine§**: `src/lib/engine/prescription.ts:264` — `if (isCompound) { return reps <= 8 ? 150 : 120; }`. For compound accessories at 9+ reps the engine returns 120s. The KB's 2–3 min range suggests 150s would be more appropriate for all compound accessories regardless of rep count.
- **Fix**: Change the compound accessory rest for reps > 8 from 120s to 150s in `prescription.ts:265`.

## 🔵 INFO / Optimizations

### I1 — No chest isolation fly in session; missing stretch-mediated stimulus

- **What**: All 15 chest sets come from compound pressing patterns (incline press, dip, push-up). The KB flags cable/dumbbell flyes as a top chest exercise for lengthened-position stimulus. A fly provides constant tension through the full arc and maximum pec stretch at end ROM — a fundamentally different mechanical advantage from pressing. All 13 fly/cable options were time-budget-excluded, so this is a time constraint issue, not a selection algorithm error.
- **KB§**: *"Top exercises: incline dumbbell press at 30°, dumbbell/cable flyes (isolation with superior stretch)"* — §4 Chest
- **Engine§**: `src/lib/engine/selection-v2/optimizer.ts` — If a chest fly's aggregate score falls below three compound exercises, it will never be selected before time expires. Consider boosting selection weight for "contrasting pattern" exercises to ensure at least one isolation/fly appears in multi-compound sessions.

### I2 — Side delt weekly volume (4 sets) will fall below MEV if push frequency is 1×/week

- **What**: This session contributes 4 direct side delt sets (Machine Lateral Raise) + 0.9 indirect (OHP). Engine MEV for side delts is 8 sets/week. If push is trained only once this week, side delts will end the week at ~4–5 effective sets — below MEV. No action needed if weekly frequency is 2+ push sessions.
- **KB§**: *"Side/Rear Delts: MEV ~6-8, MAV 16-22, MRV ~26. Tolerate very high frequency (3-6×/week) and volume."* — §2 Volume Landmarks
- **Engine§**: `src/lib/engine/volume-landmarks.ts:14` — `"Side Delts": { mv: 6, mev: 8, mav: 19, mrv: 26, sraHours: 36 }`.

---

### I3 — Machine Lateral Raise prescribed at 10 reps (low end of exercise range)

- **What**: Machine Lateral Raise has an optimal range of 10–20 reps per the rationale. At 10 reps the athlete is working at the heavier end for a pure isolation movement. The KB recommends higher rep ranges for lateral raises where relative weight jumps are large (e.g., 10→15 lbs = 50% increase). 15–20 reps would allow finer load progression and is the more typical prescription for delt isolation.
- **KB§**: *"Use wider rep ranges for exercises with large relative weight jumps (e.g., lateral raises 10-20 reps where 20→25 lbs is a 25% increase)."* — §6 Double Progression
- **Engine§**: `src/lib/engine/prescription.ts:178` — `const targetReps = effectiveAccessory[0]`. Target reps are always set to the minimum of the clamped range. Week 1 starting at the minimum is intentional; double progression will handle this naturally.

## Volume & Calibration Table

| Muscle | Engine MV | Engine MEV | Engine MAV | Engine MRV | Engine SRA (hrs) | KB MEV | KB MRV | Delta MEV | Delta MRV | Session Sets | Weekly Status |
|--------|-----------|------------|------------|------------|-----------------|--------|--------|-----------|-----------|--------------|---------------|
| Chest | 6 | 10 | 16 | 22 | 60 | 8–10 | ~22 | 0 | 0 | 15 | At MAV (15 of 16) |
| Front Delts | 0 | 0 | 7 | 12 | 48 | 0 | ~12 | 0 | 0 | **8** | **Above MAV** |
| Side Delts | 6 | 8 | 19 | 26 | 36 | 6–8 | ~26 | 0 | 0 | 4 | Below MEV |
| Triceps | 4 | 6 | 12 | 18 | 48 | 4–6 | ~18 | 0 | 0 | 11 | Approaching MAV |

No Delta values exceed ±2 sets — engine constants are well-calibrated against KB for all push-day muscles.

## Recommended Actions (Priority Order)

1. **Add per-session muscle volume cap (~10–12 sets) to the optimizer** — `src/lib/engine/selection-v2/optimizer.ts`. This one fix addresses W1, W3, and W4 simultaneously: excess chest sets, front delt MAV breach, and triceps MRV risk.

2. **Downgrade Skull Crusher's `lengthenedPositionScore` and upgrade overhead extensions** — Exercise seed data. Align the score hierarchy with Maeo 2023 so overhead extensions consistently win the triceps isolation slot when time permits (W2).

3. **Increase compound accessory rest from 120s → 150s** — `src/lib/engine/prescription.ts:265`. One-line change, directly KB-supported (W5).

4. **Audit Incline DB Bench front delt credit** — Exercise seed data. Verify whether Front Delts is classified as primary (full credit) or secondary (partial credit). If primary, reduce to secondary to prevent systematic weekly MAV violations (W3).

## What's Working Well

- **Incline DB Bench as main lift** is the exact exercise the KB cites as optimal for chest: *"incline dumbbell press at 30° (clavicular head peaks here)"* — best possible primary compound for push day.
- **Week 1 RIR = 3** precisely matches the KB mesocycle periodization table: *"Week 1: 3-4 RIR — Acclimate to new exercises/volume; establish baselines."*
- **Deficit Push-Up at 5/5 lengthened position** — outstanding stretch-mediated chest stimulus; well-supported by Wolf et al. 2023.
- **Machine Lateral Raise correctly selected over Dumbbell Lateral Raise** — the `dominated_by_better_option` filter is working correctly per Kassiano/Schoenfeld 2025 (*"dumbbell and cable lateral raises produce identical hypertrophy"* — machine version wins on SFR).
- **Volume landmark calibration is clean** — all engine constants for push muscles fall within KB-stated MEV/MRV ranges with Delta ≤ 2 sets.
- **Rest periods for main lifts (150s)** fall correctly in KB's 2–3 min guideline for moderate compounds (6–12 reps).
- **Exercise ordering** is structurally sound: both main compounds first, isolations last.
- **All exercises have SFR ≥ 3/5** — no low-efficiency junk selections.
